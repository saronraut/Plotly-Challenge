 In this Assingment, we were to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

 The Dataset revels that a small handful of microbial speices( also called operational taxonimic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of the people, while rest were relatively rare.

 
 We were to showcase our skills in: JavaScript, HTML, Plotly and D3.json.
